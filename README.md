# Blood_Pressure_Monitor
Description:

This is a self project that uses the last 15 blood pressure readings to calculate an average of your blood pressure.
Once the 15 readings of systolic and diastolic readings are applied, Python will create a scatterplot to visualize your readings. 
Python will also give you a output displaying your average, range, and if your blood pressure is normal.

Built With:
- Python 3

Prerequisites:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- datetime

Usage:

The premise of this prject is to create an average of your blood pressure from the inputed readings. Blood pressure can variate by the minute, so being able to input the last handful of readings can calcualte the status of your blood pressure while visualizing the readings.

Visualizations:
- An example of the visualization.

Output:
- The output of the data would be:
  - "Your blood pressure average is 118.0/76.73 mmHg. Your average is classified as Ideal." 
  - "Your systolic range is 109-130. Your diastolic range is 70-88."
