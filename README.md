# Blood_Pressure_Monitor
This is a self project that uses the last 15 blood pressure readings to calculate an average of your blood pressure.
Once the 15 readings of systolic and diastolic readings are applied, Python will create a scatterplot to visualize your readings. 
Python will also give you a output displaying your average, range, and if your blood pressure is normal.
